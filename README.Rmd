# Unifynd Interview Assessment: Data Analytics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the *Unifynd Interview Assessment: Data Analytics* task is to use 3 data sources (customerUser, customerScans, couponTransaction) to answer 8 data analysis questions. The questions can be found in the introductory PDF (InterviewAssignmentDataAnalytics.pdf) file in the root of the directory.

## How to use the R Markdown notebook?

* The main code file (unifyndInterviewAssesmentRNotebook.Rmd) can be found in the **R** sub-directory. 

* The main code file is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook, whose extension is **.Rmd**. You can preview this notebook using the **Preview** button, which will show you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. 

* The other option is to knit this notebook into a neat PDF, which you can do using the **Knit** button.

* Unlike **Knit**, **Preview** does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. So, when you use **Preview**, please make sure that you have once run all the chunks of code in the editor. Once you run all chunks and then preview, the resulting html output will show all code and all output (plots, tables, etc).

* This notebook contains all code, output and answers, for all of the 7 Questions (and all its sub-parts). By that I mean, it also contain answers to theory questions (ones in which I am asked about my observations and insights, e.g. Q7:part-3).

* I have also attached a complete pre-knitted PDF (with all code, output, answers) in my submission files (along side this .Rmd file).
